# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Documentation Site and README

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items pass on first validation pass; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. The user's own message already specified the presentation technology explicitly (HTML/TailwindCSS/slate-900/Iconify) and the publishing mechanism (GitHub Pages) — these are carried into the Assumptions section as explicit user constraints on implementation, kept separate from the specification's own technology-agnostic functional requirements (FR-005 through FR-011), consistent with the "Content Quality" checklist item even though the user's own request named specific tools.
